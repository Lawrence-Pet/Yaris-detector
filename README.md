# Yaris-detector
This project aims to build a realtime Toyota Yaris XP10 detector. The XP10 version 
of Toyota Yaris lasted from 1999 to 2006. In 2001 this car was considered the safest 
small car in Europe with 4 stars and 29 points. Detecting this car in traffic may 
prove useful in terms of increasing.
