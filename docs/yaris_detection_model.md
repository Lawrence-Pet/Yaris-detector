# The yaris detection model

## Dataset

There are some dataset out there with make and model, but not that many YarisXP10's for instance the dataset found at https://images.cv/dataset/car-image-classification-dataset only contains labeled yaris of later years. However the rest of the dataset may be utilized.

We also have a dataset from github https://github.com/faezetta/VMMRdb however this seems to have less variety in the images themselves. Need to investigate.
